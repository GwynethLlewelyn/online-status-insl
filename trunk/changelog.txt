== Changelog ==

_(Historical only)_

= 1.6.0 (abandoned) =
* Adds support for editor blocks (Gutenberg): unfinished!
* Several more layers of complexity in setting up the plugin, because: Gutenberg ðŸ˜©
* Currently *on hold* since other things have priority...

= 1.5.0 =
Recent versions of WordPress basically broke _everything_. So:

* Cleaned up one or two things to bring the code up to PHP 7.3+ compliance
* Fixed some fatal errors due to WP changes on the call to `WP_Widget::__construct()`
* Asked for translation validation from the WP Polyglot team; until they approve it, you can continue to use the supplied `.mo` and `.po` files
* Figured out a workaround to load the _current_ language files: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45525390/wordpress-plugin-translation-load-plugin-textdomain#comment105104921_45883184; see https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/how-to-internationalize-your-plugin/#loading-text-domain
* Fixed location of Portuguese (European) and British English translation files (Portuguese was empty!)
* Fixed a stupid copy & paste that broke `ping`
* Sprinkled a few more `esc_attr()` to prevent possible XSS attacks
* Added more 'compatible' versions (from 1.3.8 to 1.4.2 are considered 'compatible')
* Lots of (manual) pretty formatting, mostly because WP's formatting logic is weird for automated prettifiers
* Now the LSL script will use HTTPS for outgoing calls (if the WP site is set up to use `https://`); incoming calls with HTTPS are possible, _manually_ replacing `llRequestURL()` with `llRequestSecureURL()`, in SL as well as https-enabled OpenSim grids

**TODO:** Automatically detect if OpenSim has a working `llRequestSecureURL()` implementation and update script automatically

= 1.4.2 =
* Experimental support for PHP 8.0

= 1.4.1 =
* Bumped version to make sure WordPress.org doesn't de-list us from their archive
* Trying to make everything work under PHP 7.4+ without giving any warnings

= 1.4.0 =
* New backoffice display, using `WP_List_Table`. This makes it more portable to future versions and is 100% compatible with the overall look & feel of WordPress
* In-world script now allows remote reset/deletion requests. Older objects will silently fail with reset/deletion requests, but the rest of the functionality will still work!
* You can now ping in-world objects to see if they're active and/or your WP database is in sync. This will work with older scripts, too
* Objects that have the current version will have its version number coloured green; older (but functional) versions will be displayed in yellow; ancient versions (which will not work) will be displayed red
* Status display on the plugin backoffice is coloured green for online, red for offline
* You can now use bulk actions to ping/delete/reset/destroy objects
* Several sections of the code were reshuffled, and lots of comments added

= 1.3.8 =
* Changed the way avatar names are selected: now it's by object key, not avatar name (to allow avatars on OpenSim grids to be tracked)
* Because 1.3.7 didn't fix the deletion error, new code was developed using the above changes; this might invalidate previous versions! (Because objects are now tracked by object key and not avatar name, previous settings might have invalid data)
* Avatar profile pictures do not use `align=XXX` tags but instead the class gets `aligncenter`, `alignleft`, `alignright` for consistency with WP, current themes, and recent CSS versions
* When selecting an avatar name on the Widget, it displays region and position (to allow avatars with the same name in different grids to be easily selected)
* Added `objectkey` option for the shortcode (to deal with avatars with the same name in different grids)
* Added fancy banner
* Added a few extra translations (they only appeared on in-world HTTP-in responses, not on WP)
* Confirmed compatibility with WP 3.9
* Users upgrading directly from 1.0 (or earlier versions) should now manually delete the `channel.inc` file under `wp-content/uploads`

= 1.3.7 =
* Minor retweaking of the logic for deleting online status indicators from the admin page

= 1.3.6 =
* Fixed tiny bug with incompatible function names with other plugins of mine

= 1.3.5 =
* Added support for multiple languages. Portuguese was added. [Translators welcome](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/online-status-insl/)!
* Fixed issue for avatars with "Resident" as their last name (links to profile images were broken)
* Fixed minor programming issues and alt/title tags for the images for full HTML compliance

= 1.3.0 =
* Completely changed the communications protocol. Now no HTTP-in calls are used. This makes the widget much faster to show on pages, and should lead to less "status unknown errors". Thanks to [Celebrity Trollop](https://my.secondlife.com/celebrity.trollop) for proposing a much simpler way to the code design!
* Additionally, shortcodes were not really working _unless_ there was also a widget on the blog. The change should now fix this.

= 1.2.1 =
* Fixed lack of return code on HTTP requests to in-world objects, probably caused by timeouts. Thanks for Puilia for checking it and to Celebrity Trollop for providing a simple fix (I've also added 60 seconds of timeout instead of the default of 5)

= 1.2.0 =
* Adds SL profile picture to the widget, to the backoffice, and to shortcodes
* Added the ability to delete entries from the database
* Changed LSL script to be inside a textarea for better layout
* Fixed shortcode bugs and added new options
* Fixed incorrect saving of serialized settings and added `maybe_unserialize()` to deal with warnings when serialization was not required (happened when multiple widgets were used)
* Added `target="_blank"` on links to avatar profile and object location
* Removed dependency on `cURL`

= 1.1.2 =
* More URL bug fixes, solved with `rawurlencode()`

= 1.1.1 =
* Fixes a bug on links when in-world object names have single quotes in the names

= 1.1.0 =
* Implements the Shortcode API for embedding the status on a page or post (with its own CSS classes)
* Added further snapshots to help out the installation process in Second Life

= 1.0 =
Major upgrade! Note that the old version of the LSL script will not work any longer! You need to replace all in-world scripted objects manually!

* Uses `HTTPRequest` and `HTTP-in` instead of XML-RPC
* Supports multiple avatars and multiple widgets
* Options are now saved using the WP mechanism instead of using external files
* Uses a caching mechanism to reduce the number of requests to the simulators
* Added CSS `div` and `span` for the widget to allow restyling

= 0.9.1 =
* Added some contributed code by [SignpostMarv](https://signpostmarv.name/) replacing obsolete attribute escaping code
* Added smaller screenshot
* Added a FAQ Q&A for "status unknown"

= 0.9 =
* First release.
